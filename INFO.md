## :warning: Development version

which is @sveinse fork of upstream/official zaptec integration at
https://github.com/custom-components/zaptec.
This is under active development, and any feedback on your experience using it
is very appreciated.

**:warning:  WARNING!** This is a major refactor of the upstream zaptec
integration. The names and device setup has been significantly refactored.

## Beta testing

The component is currently under beta testing. Any feedback on problems,
improvements or joy can be given at: https://github.com/sveinse/zaptec/issues

In particular the following items is of particular interest:

* Is everything working as it should? Any error messages?
* Does your autpmations and operation of the charger work with your use?
* Any missing entities (sensors, buttons, switches)?
* Are the new entity names ok?

In some cases it would help debugging to have access to the diagnostics info.
Please see the "Diagnostics" section below in how to generate if it is requested.
